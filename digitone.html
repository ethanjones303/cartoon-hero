	<h1>Digitone - A New Way of Sequencing</h1>

	


		<p class="righttxt">The Digitone combines Elektron's coveted digital synthesis with an extremely powerful sequencer. With up to 8 voices of polyphony, this unassuming black box holds a huge amount of potential. The Digitone has found a place in many modern producers hearts as a source of great inspiration and a powerful production tool. The interface can at first seem daunting and perhaps overwhelming. However, it only takes an hour or two to see that everything makes logical sense.</p>

	<h2>Sequencer</h2>

		<p class="lefttxt">The sequencer is arguably the biggest draw to the digitone. The unique 'parameter lock' capabilities mean it functions like no other one out there. Simply put, parameter locks enable you to make every step in a sequence different not only in terms of pitch but sound, volume, length, FX amount and much more. This opens huge possibilities. As well as controlling 4 synth tracks inside, the Digitone can also sequence 4 external MIDI tracks via its MIDI out port. These tracks also utilise the unique sequencing capabilities, meaning other synths can benefit from the machine. </p>
